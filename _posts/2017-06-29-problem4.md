Takes in a list of lists. Output is a list classifying each member as open or senior

{% highlight python %}
def openOrSenior(data):
    res = []
    for i in data:
      if i[0] >= 55 and i[1] > 7:
        res.append("Senior")
      else:
        res.append("Open")
    return res

 #expected output example: ['open','senior','senior','open']
{% endhighlight %}
