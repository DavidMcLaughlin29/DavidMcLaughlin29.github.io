This is my personal website made with Jekyll and hosted with Github Pages. My name is David McLaughlin. I am from West Virginia, but now live in Greenville, SC. The purpose of this site is to show that I know how to code, and document my progress.

For the past 6 years I have worked as a Licensed Practical Nurse in various settings. In September 2016 I decided to learn to program, and finish my IT degree at Southern New Hampshire University. I will graduate in November, and will be starting the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science curriculum. I have been interested in computer science, programming, and IT most of my life, but I didn't get serious about it until then. Once I got started and learned the fundamentals I began to love it. I completed Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree in 3 months, learned the basics of object-oriented programming with Python, Linux and the command line, SQL, Git, and web development. I am mainly self-taught, though I have learned a bit in the associates degree program at SNHU, some Java and networking, for example. I don't mean to diminish the value of a college education; I just learn better on my own, and there are many great free resources, such as Udacity, YouTube, MIT and Harvard's free CS courses, Codeacademy, Stackoverflow, TutorialsPoint, the Python Standard Library, among others. I have also been reading Computer Science and programming books such as Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software, How to Think Like A Computer Scientist, and The Pragmatic Programmer.

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read. There will be frequent updates as I complete more problems and projects.
