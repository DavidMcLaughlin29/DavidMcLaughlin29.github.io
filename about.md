This is my personal website made with Jekyll and hosted with Github Pages. My name is David McLaughlin and I am from the mountains of West Virginia. I will be reloating to the Greenville, SC soon. My goal right now is to get a software development job. The main purpose of this site is to show that I know how to code. For the past 6 years I have worked as a nurse. A little over a year ago I decided I wanted to learn to program and finish my degree. Once I got started and got over that initial learning curve I started to love it. I learned the basics of object-oriented programming with Python, linux and the command line, git, and web development. In October of 2016 I decided to quit my nursing job and take a couple months off to study full time. I am ready for my first programming job. 

Thank you for taking the time to read. There will be frequent updates.
