This is my personal website made with Jekyll and hosted with Github Pages. My name is David McLaughlin and I am from the mountains of West Virginia. I am a Licensed Practical Nurse by trade. I am a musician as well and play professionally on the side. The main purpose of this site is to show that I know how to code. My goal is to get a programming job.

For the past 6 years I have worked as a nurse in various settings. Around 9 months ago I decided I wanted to learn to program, and finish my IT degree at Southern New Hampshire University. I will graduate in November. Once I got started and learned the fundamentals I began to love it. I learned the basics of object-oriented programming with Python, Linux and the command line, SQL, Git, and web development. I am mainly self-taught, though I have learned a bit in the degree program, some Java for example. I don't mean to bash a college education; I just learn better on my own, and there are so many great resources out there for free, such as Udacity, YouTube, Codeacademy, Stackoverflow, TutorialsPoint, and the Python Standard Library. I have also been reading some books such as Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software, and The Pragmatic Programmer.

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read. There will be frequent updates.
