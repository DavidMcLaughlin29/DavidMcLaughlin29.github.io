This is my personal website made with Jekyll and hosted with Github Pages. My name is David McLaughlin and I am from the mountains of West Virginia. I am a Licensed Practical Nurse by trade. I am a musician as well and play professionally on the side. The main purpose of this site is to show that I know how to code. For the past 6 years I have worked as a nurse in various settings.

A little over a year ago I decided I wanted to learn to program, and finish my degree IT degree at Southern New Hampshire University. I will graduate in November. Once I got started and got over that initial learning curve I started to love it. I learned the basics of object-oriented programming with Python, linux and the command line, git, and web development. I am mainly self-taught, though I have learned a bit in the degree program. The resources I have used are Udacity, Lynda, YouTube, Codeacademy, Stackoverflow, the Python Library, Pluralsight, and some books. In October of 2016 I decided to take a break from nursing job and take a couple months off to study full time. I got a job as a package handler at FedEx to float me while I studied.

Thank you for taking the time to read. There will be frequent updates.
