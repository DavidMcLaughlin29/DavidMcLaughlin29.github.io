This is my personal website built with Jekyll and hosted with Github Pages. My name is David McLaughlin. I am from West Virginia, but now live in Greenville, SC. The purpose of this site is to show that I know how to code, and document my progress. My goal is to become a competent and well-rounded programmer.

Since 2011, I have worked as a Licensed Practical Nurse in various settings. In September 2016 I decided to learn to program, and finish my IT degree at Southern New Hampshire University. I completed Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree in 3 months, in which I learned the basics of object-oriented programming with Python, Linux and the command line, SQL, Git, and web development. I will graduate in November from SNHU with my Associate of Science in Information Technology, and will be starting the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science curriculum, which will be completed by the end of 2019. 

Outside of school and traditional courses I have been learning on my own, utilzing resources like Udacity, Youtube, Stackoverflow, CodeAcademy, and reading Computer Science and programming books such as Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software, How to Think Like A Computer Scientist, and The Pragmatic Programmer, from which I have learned much. In school I have gained experience with Java and networking. In future classes I will be working with C++.

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read. There will be frequent updates as I complete more problems and projects.
